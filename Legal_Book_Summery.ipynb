allowed CWP No 20630 of 2006 relating thereto titled Suman Lata and others vs The State of Haryana and others  by order dated 22022007 However by judgment dated 24112021 this Court 1allowed Civil Appeal No 7031 of 2021 titled Devender Bhaskar  others vs State of Haryana  others  and set aside the aforestated order dated 22022007 This Court held that equivalence of qualifications is a matter for the State as the recruiting authority to determine This observation was made in the context of the High Courts finding that the Diploma in Art  Craft of Kurukshetra University was equivalent to the Diploma in Art  Craft of Haryana Industrial Training Department 2Review of the above judgment dated 24112021 is sought by way of the present petitions The review petitioners 404 in all secured Diplomas in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University and are aggrieved by the finding of nonequivalence of their qualification with the Diploma in Art  Craft of the Haryana Industrial Training Department The petitions for review are granted and the matter reheard at length 3Advertisement No62006 was issued on 20072006 by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission for filling up 816 posts of Art  Craft Teachers in the State of Haryana The eligibility criteria prescribed therefor included inter alia a 2year Diploma in Art  Craft conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana Education Department Controversy arose visàvis this eligibility condition as the Director School Education Haryana issued letter dated 12122006 intimating that the Diploma in Art  Craft conducted by the Director Industrial Training and Vocational Education Haryana was the only recognized course in the State of Haryana and that the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University and other Universities was not recognized for the purpose of appointment to the post of Art  Craft 2Teacher in the State of Haryana It was this communication that was challenged before the Punjab  Haryana High Court in a batch of writ petitions leading to the aforestated order dated 22022007 holding that the 2year Diploma in Art  Craft offered by the Kurukshetra University had already been recognized by the State of Haryana in 1999 and that the impugned communication dated 12122006 did not disclose any policy decision to the contrary However as stated supra this Court reversed the said verdict vide the judgment dated 24112021 4Be it noted that aggrieved by the action of the authorities in not entertaining their applications on the ground that they had secured Diplomas from Kurukshetra University a number of prospective candidates had filed writ petitions before the Punjab  Haryana High Court and interim orders were passed therein permitting such persons to provisionally participate in the selection conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission While so the selection held pursuant to Advertisement No 62006 was quashed by a learned Judge of the Punjab  Haryana High Court vide judgment dated 20022015 in CWP No 18482 of 2020 The same stood confirmed in LPA No 359 of 2015 when it was dismissed by a Division Bench on 10102020 Special Leave Petition C No 14481 of 2020 filed before this Court against these decisions was also dismissed on 14122020 Pursuant thereto a fresh selection was held resulting in the selection list dated 14112021 communicated by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission to the Director General Elementary Education Haryana under letter dated 17112021 This list indicated that 756 candidates stood selected and 64 candidates were waitlisted In all 820 candidates found place therein Out of these 820 candidates 3613 of the selected candidates and 54 candidates in the waiting list held Diplomas from Kurukshetra University On 04032022 the Haryana Staff Selection Commission recommended the appointment of only 153 candidates out of the 820 candidates as the remaining 667 candidates possessed Diplomas from Kurukshetra University After this Court allowed Civil Appeal No 7031 of 2021 by judgment dated 24112021 a batch of writ petitions came to be filed before the Punjab  Haryana High Court once again These cases were disposed of by the High Court vide order dated 09112022 in CWP No 24339 of 2021 and batch titled Manoj Kumar  others vs State of Haryana  others whereby the authorities were directed to complete the selection process within a time frame subject to the result of these review petitions pending before this Court Pursuant to the said direction the Haryana Staff Selection Commission addressed letter dated 27122022 recommending 178 candidates for appointment These candidates possessed Diplomas in Art  Craft from the Haryana Industrial Training Department and other institutions and not from Kurukshetra University In effect 331 appointments were made leaving 485 of the 816 notified posts vacant 5Other candidates who stood similarly situated to the review petitioners filed implead applications in Review Petition C No154 of 2022 seeking to come on record therein so as to protect their own interests Those who are identically placed with the review petitioners in terms of having Diplomas in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University and were included in the selection list dated 14112021 would be entitled to intervene in Review Petition C No154 of

of 2022 are allowed and the applicants therein 102 in all are brought on record However insofar as three of the applicants in IA No 95284 of 2023 are concerned viz Urmila Devi Suman Lata and Jyoti their results are yet to be declared and as of now they do not find mention in the selection list dated 14112021 So too is the case with Vivek Kumar the applicant in IA D No 106171 of 2023 They would be entitled to relief if any subject to declaration of their results and their securing a place in the selection list 6Similar applications were filed in Review Petition No 450 of 2022 by candidates identically situated to the review petitioners therein In consequence IA D Nos 95410  99854 of 2023 are allowed and the 37 applicants therein are brought on record IA No 131988 of 2022 was filed by the review petitioners in Review Petition No 450 of 2022 seeking to implead Kurukshetra University Haryana as a party respondent However in the light of the stand now taken by the Government of Haryana the IA is rendered otiose and is accordingly rejected 7Candidates who did not pass either the selection examination or the interview and did not figure in the selection list dated 14112021 cannot now seek to be placed on par with those who were either selected or waitlisted therein They would therefore not be entitled to intervene in the review petitions and seek relief be it by asking for relaxation or reduction of the pass marks in the selection 5examination or interview IA D Nos 95450  95452 of 2023 95458 of 2023 106402  106403 and 101791 of 2023 in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 are dismissed IA D No84254 of 2023 in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 is dismissed in so far as Applicant No14 therein is concerned Applicant Nos 1 to 13 also filed IA D Nos 93707  95065 of 2023 which are considered hereunder 8Those thirteen candidates were appointed pursuant to the second recommendation letter dated 27122022 of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and filed IA D Nos 93707  95065 of 2023 seeking to be impleaded in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 As they have a vital interest in the outcome of the review petition their applications are allowed and they are brought on record However respondent Nos 324 328 329 334 338 358 373 and 380 in Review Petition C No154 of 2022 who held the prescribed Diploma in Art  Craft from the Haryana Industrial Training Department failed to qualify in the selection process They therefore cannot seek any relief from this Court 9In so far as the merits of these review petitions are concerned it may be noted that pursuant to the order dated 16051999 passed by the Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 16320 of 1996 titled Ram Bhagat  others vs State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions other than Universities established by law or by Deemed Universities Accepting the report of the Committee the Financial Commissioner  Secretary to Government Education Department Haryana addressed letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated 12122006 stating to the contrary 10While so it is now the admitted position that the Government of Haryana is willing to accept the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University as an equivalent qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and attainment level It was approved by the ViceChancellor of the Kurukshetra University and the same was accordingly informed to the Director Elementary Education Haryana 711That apart letter dated 19052023 addressed by the Director Elementary Education Haryana to Mr Lokesh

including 178 candidates appointed conditionally vide order dated 09112022 passed by Honble Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 24339 of 2021 The above said decision taken by the Government not to be treated as precedent Hence it is requested to apprise above said facts before the Honble Court during the course of hearing of the case Sd 18523 Joint Director TGT RA for Director Elementary Educational Haryana Panchkula 812The above communication manifests that the Government of Haryana is now ready to accommodate and appoint candidates with Diplomas in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University who were found meritorious and were included in the selection list dated 14112021 without adversely affecting the 178 candidates who were conditionally appointed pursuant to the directions of the Punjab  Haryana High Court As it is no longer in issue that the Diplomas in Art  Craft secured from Kurukshetra University by the 667 candidates in the selection list dated 14112021 stand on par with the Diploma in Art  Craft from Haryana Industrial Training Department there would be no hindrance to their being considered for appointment and this Court is not required to venture into the equivalence of these qualifications However such appointments would now have to be made against the 663 notified vacant posts that would be available as the 178 appointees are being treated as distinct and separate These 178 appointees would have to be excluded from the count of the notified posts under Advertisement No 62006 as they were converted as Art  Craft Teachers Diminishing Cadre Appointments to be made pursuant to this judgment would have to be limited to the vacant posts notified under Advertisement No62006 and cannot be extended to later vacancies which have arisen thereafter Further the appointing authority would have to strictly go by the merit ranking in the selection list dated 14112021 while making appointments to these available notified vacancies without disturbing the appointments already made or the seniority of such appointees irrespective of whether or not such appointees found mention in the selection list dated 14112021 and if they did their merit ranking therein This is because the review petitioners and others identically 9situated are now being accommodated and appointed despite the long lapse of time since the inception of this recruitment process and more particularly as those who were appointed have already put in significant length of regular service prior to the belated entry of the new appointees into regular service at this stage The entire exercise pursuant to this judgment shall be completed by the authorities concerned expeditiously and in any event not later than two months from the date of receipt of a copy of

concerned it may be noted that pursuant to the order dated 16051999 passed by the Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 16320 of 1996 titled Ram Bhagat  others vs State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions other than Universities

other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated 12122006 stating to the contrary 10While so it is now the admitted position that the Government of Haryana is willing to accept the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University as an equivalent qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and attainment level

letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated

qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and

the Haryana Industrial Training Department failed to qualify in the selection process They therefore cannot seek any relief from this Court 9In so far as the merits of these review petitions are concerned it may be noted that pursuant to the order dated 16051999 passed by the Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 16320 of 1996 titled Ram Bhagat  others vs State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions other than Universities

other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated 12122006 stating to the contrary 10While so it is now the admitted position that the Government of Haryana is willing to accept the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University as an equivalent qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and attainment level

State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions

letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated

qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and

State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions

letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated

qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and

letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated

qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and

the Haryana Industrial Training Department failed to qualify in the selection process They therefore cannot seek any relief from this Court 9In so far as the merits of these review petitions are concerned it may be noted that pursuant to the order dated 16051999 passed by the Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 16320 of 1996 titled Ram Bhagat  others vs State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions other than Universities

other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated 12122006 stating to the contrary 10While so it is now the admitted position that the Government of Haryana is willing to accept the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University as an equivalent qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and attainment level

No 95284 of 2023 are concerned viz Urmila Devi Suman Lata and Jyoti their results are yet to be declared and as of now they do not find mention in the selection list dated 14112021 So too is the case with Vivek Kumar the applicant in IA D No 106171 of 2023 They would be entitled to relief if any subject to declaration of their results and their securing a place in the selection list 6Similar applications were filed in Review Petition No 450 of 2022 by candidates identically situated to the review petitioners therein In consequence IA D Nos 95410  99854 of 2023 are allowed and the 37 applicants therein are brought on record IA No 131988 of 2022 was filed by the review petitioners in Review Petition No 450 of 2022 seeking to implead Kurukshetra University Haryana as a party respondent However in the light of the stand now taken by the Government of Haryana the IA is rendered otiose and is accordingly rejected 7Candidates who did not pass either the selection examination or the interview and did not figure in the selection list dated 14112021 cannot now seek to be placed on par with those who were either selected or waitlisted therein They would therefore not be entitled to intervene in the review petitions and seek relief be it by asking for relaxation or reduction of the pass marks in the selection 5examination or interview IA D Nos 95450  95452 of 2023 95458 of 2023 106402  106403 and 101791 of 2023 in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 are dismissed IA D No84254 of 2023 in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 is dismissed in so far as Applicant No14 therein is concerned Applicant Nos 1 to 13 also filed IA D Nos 93707  95065 of 2023 which are considered hereunder 8Those thirteen candidates were appointed pursuant to the second recommendation letter dated 27122022 of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and filed IA D Nos 93707  95065 of 2023 seeking to be impleaded in Review Petition C No 154 of 2022 As they have a vital interest in the outcome of the review petition their applications are allowed and they are brought on record However respondent Nos 324 328 329 334 338 358 373 and 380 in Review Petition C No154 of 2022 who held the prescribed Diploma in Art  Craft from the Haryana Industrial Training Department failed to qualify in the selection process They therefore cannot seek any relief from this Court 9In so far as the merits of these review petitions are concerned it may be noted that pursuant to the order dated 16051999 passed by the Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 16320 of 1996 titled Ram Bhagat  others vs State of Haryana  others  the Government of Haryana had constituted a Committee to go into the issue of equivalence and recognition of Examinations DegreesDiplomasCertificates awarded by Institutions other than Universities established by law or by Deemed Universities Accepting the report of the Committee the Financial Commissioner  Secretary to Government Education Department Haryana addressed letter dated 02111999 to other authorities in the 6State informing them that it had been decided that the DegreesDiplomas CertificatesExaminations of Kurukshetra University amongst others would be recognized in the State of Haryana for admission and recruitment purposes It was in the light of this policy decision that the Punjab  Haryana High Court set aside the later communication dated 12122006 stating to the contrary 10While so it is now the admitted position that the Government of Haryana is willing to accept the Diploma in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University as an equivalent qualification to the Diploma in Art  Craft secured from Haryana Industrial Training Department It appears that the Director Elementary Education Haryana addressed letter dated 23012023 to Kurukshetra University seeking a clarification regarding the equivalence of these qualifications Reference was made therein to the letter dated 08122021 issued by the Kurukshetra University certifying that the Art  Craft Diploma offered by it was equivalent for all purposes to the Art  Craft course conducted by the ITI Haryana In response thereto the Kurukshetra University addressed letter dated 31012023 stating that a Standing Committee was constituted to examine the matter of equivalence and pursuant to its deliberations in the meeting held on 08122021 the Committee recommended that both the courses be treated as equivalent for all purposes This recommendation was made after comparing the syllabus and finding that both courses were of equal standard in terms of content credit requirements and attainment level It was approved by the ViceChancellor of the Kurukshetra University and the same was accordingly informed to the Director Elementary Education Haryana 711That apart letter dated 19052023 addressed by the Director Elementary Education Haryana to Mr Lokesh Sinhal learned Senior Additional Advocate General Haryana is placed on record and it reads as follows  From Director Elementary Education Haryana Shiksha Sadan Sector 5 Panchkula To Sh Lokesh Sinhal Senior Additional Advocate General Haryana Supreme Court of India New Delhi Memo No 171402022 TGT RA4 Dated Panchkula the 18052023 Subject Review Petition No 154 of 2022 titled Neeraj Kumar  Anr Versus State of Haryana  Ors and connected Review Petitions in Civil Appeal No 7031 of 2021  Respected Sir In reference to your Email dated 16052023  17052023 it is submitted that the Government has given permissionone time relaxation to convert 178 posts of TGT Art to the post of Art  Craft Teacher Diminishing Cadre so that all the review petitioners and effected person having Diploma from Kurukshetra University Kurukshetra ie 667 candidates who were in the first select list dated 17112021 sent by HSSC can be accommodated without effecting any person who has already been appointed including 178 candidates appointed conditionally vide order dated 09112022 passed by Honble Punjab  Haryana High Court in CWP No 24339 of 2021 The above said decision taken by the Government not to be treated as precedent Hence it is requested to apprise above said facts before the Honble Court during the course of hearing of the case Sd 18523 Joint Director TGT RA for Director Elementary Educational Haryana Panchkula 812The above communication manifests that the Government of Haryana is now ready to accommodate and appoint candidates with Diplomas in Art  Craft from Kurukshetra University who were found meritorious and were included in the selection list dated 14112021 without adversely affecting the 178 candidates who were conditionally appointed pursuant to the directions of the Punjab  Haryana High Court As it is no longer in issue that the Diplomas in Art  Craft secured from Kurukshetra University by the 667 candidates in the selection list dated 14112021 stand on par with the Diploma in Art  Craft from Haryana Industrial Training Department there would be no hindrance to their being considered for appointment and this Court is not required to venture into the equivalence of these qualifications However such appointments would now have to be made against the 663 notified vacant posts that would be available as the 178 appointees are being treated as distinct and separate These 178 appointees would have to be excluded from the count of the notified posts under Advertisement No 62006 as they were converted as Art  Craft Teachers Diminishing Cadre Appointments to be made pursuant to this judgment would have to be limited to the vacant posts notified under Advertisement No62006 and cannot be extended to later vacancies which have arisen thereafter Further the appointing authority would have to strictly go by the merit ranking in the selection list dated 14112021 while making appointments to these available notified vacancies without disturbing the appointments already made or the seniority of such appointees irrespective of whether or not such appointees found mention in the selection list dated 14112021 and if they did their merit ranking therein This is because the review petitioners and others identically 9situated are now being accommodated and appointed despite the long lapse of time since the inception of this recruitment process and more particularly as those who were appointed have already put in significant length of regular service prior to the belated entry of the new appointees into regular service at this stage The entire exercise pursuant to this judgment shall be completed by the authorities concerned expeditiously and in any event not later than two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment The review petitions are disposed of accordingly Other pending IAs shall also stand disposed of In the circumstances there shall be no order as to costs J KRISHNA MURARI  J SANJAY KUMAR  New Delhi July 3 2023 10']\n",
